# Overview

**Rent a car** is an console application that was developed using C#. The system was a mandatory project for course "Design patterns". In the project we were given a description of a problem that we needed to solve in our own way using C# and GOF design patterns. In the first phase of the project we were permitted to use only creational design patterns, then in the second and third phase new features needed to be implemented by refactoring the old code and adding structural and behavioral design patterns.
